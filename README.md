# CarDekho_Project
This project was created with MySQL, and the results and insights were visually presented using Microsoft PowerPoint. I have also uploaded the PDF file of the presentation.
With more than 15,400 cars data present in the csv file dataset, My aim and objective of creating this project was to help customers find their dream car according to their budget and requirements.
Developed complex SQL queries using SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, JOIN, and LIMIT clauses for targeted data extraction and analysis. Conditional logic and categorization using CASE WHEN, UPDATE, and range-based filtering for budget segmentation and customer targeting.
